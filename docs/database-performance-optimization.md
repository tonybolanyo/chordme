## Monitoring and Alerting

### Performance Metrics

The system automatically collects and analyzes:

1. **Query Metrics**
   - Execution time
   - Row counts
   - Query frequency
   - Error rates

2. **Connection Pool Metrics**
   - Active connections
   - Pool utilization
   - Connection wait times
   - Invalid connections

3. **Index Usage Statistics**
   - Index scan counts
   - Index effectiveness
   - Storage utilization
   - Maintenance requirements

4. **Replica Health Metrics**
   - Response times
   - Replication lag
   - Availability status
   - Load distribution

### Alert Conditions

Automatic alerts are triggered for:

- Slow queries exceeding threshold (configurable, default: 1 second)
- High connection pool usage (>80%)
- Replica health failures
- High replication lag
- Maintenance task failures
- Performance degradation patterns

### Custom Monitoring Integration

Integrate with external monitoring systems:

```python
from chordme.database_performance import db_performance

# Get current metrics for external monitoring
stats = db_performance.get_query_statistics()
pool_status = db_performance.get_connection_pool_status()
analysis = db_performance.analyze_query_patterns()

# Send to your monitoring system
send_to_monitoring_system({
    'query_stats': stats,
    'pool_status': pool_status,
    'performance_analysis': analysis
})
```

## Best Practices

### Query Optimization

1. **Use Index Recommendations**: Regularly review and implement high-priority index recommendations
2. **Monitor Slow Queries**: Set appropriate slow query thresholds and investigate patterns
3. **Optimize N+1 Queries**: Use the analysis features to identify and fix N+1 query patterns
4. **Use Read Replicas**: Route read-heavy operations to read replicas

### Connection Pool Management

1. **Right-size Pools**: Monitor pool usage and adjust sizes based on actual demand
2. **Monitor Health**: Set up alerts for pool exhaustion and connection issues
3. **Use Connection Recycling**: Enable connection recycling to prevent stale connections

### Read Replica Configuration

1. **Geographic Distribution**: Place replicas close to read-heavy users
2. **Load Balancing**: Use weighted strategies to balance load appropriately
3. **Monitor Lag**: Set appropriate lag thresholds and monitor replication health
4. **Failover Planning**: Ensure primary database can handle full load if replicas fail

### Maintenance Scheduling

1. **Off-Peak Execution**: Schedule intensive maintenance during low-traffic periods
2. **Monitor Impact**: Track maintenance task performance and adjust frequency
3. **Backup Before Changes**: Always backup before major maintenance operations
4. **Test in Staging**: Test maintenance procedures in staging environment first

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High CPU Usage

```bash
# Check for missing indexes
flask db_analyze_indexes

# Look for N+1 query patterns
flask db_performance_stats

# Review slow queries
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/v1/admin/database/performance/stats
```

#### Connection Pool Exhaustion

```bash
# Check pool status
flask db_performance_stats

# Review connection usage patterns
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/v1/admin/database/health
```

#### Slow Query Performance

```bash
# Analyze query patterns
flask db_performance_stats

# Get index recommendations
flask db_analyze_indexes

# Create recommended indexes
flask db_create_recommended_indexes
```

#### Replica Lag Issues

```bash
# Check replica health
flask db_replica_status

# Perform health checks
flask db_replica_health_check
```

### Performance Tuning

#### PostgreSQL Specific

```sql
-- Check query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT ...;

-- Update table statistics manually
ANALYZE table_name;

-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

#### SQLite Specific

```sql
-- Analyze query plans
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT ...;

-- Update statistics
ANALYZE;

-- Check index information
PRAGMA index_list(table_name);
PRAGMA index_info(index_name);
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- Database performance endpoints require admin authentication
- Use strong authentication mechanisms for admin access
- Audit admin access to performance features
- Limit read replica access to appropriate networks

### Data Protection

- Performance metrics may contain sensitive query information
- Configure appropriate data retention policies
- Secure monitoring and alerting channels
- Encrypt connections to read replicas

### Operational Security

- Monitor for unusual query patterns that might indicate attacks
- Set up alerts for performance anomalies
- Regularly review and rotate database credentials
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- Review performance statistics weekly
- Implement high-priority index recommendations monthly
- Verify backup and recovery procedures quarterly
- Update performance thresholds based on growth annually

### Monitoring Checklist

- [ ] Query performance within acceptable limits
- [ ] Connection pool usage optimal
- [ ] Read replicas healthy and balanced
- [ ] Maintenance tasks running successfully
- [ ] Alerts configured and functioning
- [ ] Performance trends tracked over time

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Performance Degradation**: Use health check endpoint to identify issues quickly
2. **Database Outage**: Verify replica status and failover procedures
3. **High Load**: Check connection pool status and consider scaling
4. **Data Issues**: Review recent maintenance tasks and query patterns
