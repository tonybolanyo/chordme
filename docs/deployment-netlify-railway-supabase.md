```

### Workflow Orchestration
```
GitHub Actions (Main Branch)
├── validate (tests, build, lint)
├── deploy-database (migrations)
├── deploy-backend (Railway)
├── deploy-frontend (Netlify)
├── e2e-tests (integration validation)
└── summary (deployment status)
```

## [SYMBOL] Files Added/Modified

### Configuration Files
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify deployment configuration
- `railway.toml` - Railway deployment configuration  
- `nixpacks.toml` - Railway build configuration
- `vercel.json` - Updated for Railway backend URLs
- `.env.example` - Environment variable templates

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- `.github/workflows/deploy-netlify.yml` - Netlify deployment workflow
- `.github/workflows/deploy-railway.yml` - Railway deployment workflow
- `.github/workflows/deploy-full-stack.yml` - Complete deployment orchestration

### Database & Migrations
- `database/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` - Initial database schema
- `database/migrate.py` - Migration execution script

### Deployment Scripts
- `scripts/deployment/deploy-netlify.sh` - Local Netlify deployment
- `scripts/deployment/deploy-railway.sh` - Local Railway deployment
- `scripts/deployment/deploy-full-stack.sh` - Complete local deployment
- `scripts/deployment/health-check.py` - Post-deployment validation

### Backend Updates
- `backend/config.template.py` - Enhanced with environment variable support
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Added PostgreSQL and Supabase dependencies

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Added deployment commands and workflow documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide with new stack

## [Quick Start] Usage

### Automated Deployment (GitHub Actions)
```bash
# Automatic on push to main
git push origin main

# Manual deployment via GitHub Actions
gh workflow run deploy-full-stack.yml -f environment=production

# PR deployments (automatic)
# Creates preview URLs with health checks
```

### Local Deployment
```bash
# Full stack deployment
npm run deploy:production

# Individual components
npm run deploy:netlify
npm run deploy:railway
npm run migrate

# Health checks
npm run health-check --frontend-url=https://app.netlify.app --backend-url=https://api.railway.app
```

### Environment Setup
1. **Supabase**: Create project, get connection strings
2. **Railway**: Create project, get project/service IDs  
3. **Netlify**: Create site, get auth token and site ID
4. **GitHub Secrets**: Configure deployment credentials

## [Security] Security Features

- **Environment Variables**: All secrets externalized and parameterized
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level access control
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: SSL/TLS for all communications
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin request handling
- **Security Headers**: XSS protection, content type validation
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All credentials managed via environment variables

## [SYMBOL] Testing & Validation

- **Pre-deployment Validation**: Tests, linting, building
- **Health Checks**: API endpoints, database connectivity, frontend loading
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-service communication validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with detailed reporting
- **Rollback Support**: Automatic reversion on deployment failures

## [SYMBOL] Cost Optimization

- **Netlify**: Free tier for frontend hosting
- **Railway**: Pay-per-use container hosting
- **Supabase**: Free tier with PostgreSQL and auth
- **GitHub Actions**: Included with repository

Total estimated cost: **$0-25/month** depending on usage.

## [Target] Next Steps

1. **Configure Secrets**: Set up GitHub repository secrets for deployment
2. **Test Deployments**: Run through staging deployment process
3. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production environment
4. **Monitor & Optimize**: Set up monitoring and performance optimization

This implementation provides a production-ready, scalable deployment solution that meets all requirements specified in issue #213.
