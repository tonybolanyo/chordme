## Issue #92: Proper Quoting of VERSION Variable

### Problem
The `npm version` command can be vulnerable to shell injection and unexpected behavior if the VERSION variable is not properly quoted.

### Solution
All `npm version` commands must quote the VERSION variable:
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Properly quoted
npm version "$VERSION" --no-git-tag-version

# ❌ INCORRECT - Unquoted (potentially dangerous)
npm version $VERSION --no-git-tag-version
```

### Security Implications

#### Without Quoting (Dangerous)
```bash
VERSION='1.0.0$(echo "-injected")'
npm version $VERSION --no-git-tag-version
# Could result in command injection!
```

#### With Quoting (Safe)
```bash
VERSION='1.0.0$(echo "-injected")'
npm version "$VERSION" --no-git-tag-version
# npm safely rejects the invalid version string
```

### Current Implementation Status

✅ **All npm version commands are properly quoted in ChordMe:**

1. **scripts/sync-version.sh** (lines 21, 26):
   ```bash
   npm version "$VERSION" --no-git-tag-version
   ```

2. **.github/workflows/release.yml** (lines 62, 66):
   ```bash
   npm version "$VERSION" --no-git-tag-version
   ```

### Best Practices

1. **Always quote shell variables** when they contain user input or data that might contain special characters
2. **Use `--no-git-tag-version`** to prevent automatic git tagging during version updates
3. **Validate version strings** before using them in scripts
4. **Test with edge cases** to ensure security and reliability

### Testing

The security of our implementation has been validated with comprehensive tests including:
- Normal semantic versions (1.2.3, 2.0.0-alpha, etc.)
- Potentially dangerous strings with shell metacharacters
- Command injection attempts
- Variable expansion attempts

All tests confirm that our quoted implementation is secure and handles edge cases properly.
