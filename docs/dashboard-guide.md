# Dashboard Layout and Sharing Features

This document describes the enhanced dashboard layout that separates songs into distinct sections based on ownership and sharing permissions.

## Dashboard Sections

### My Songs
- **Purpose**: Shows songs owned by the current user
- **Criteria**: Songs where `author_id` matches the current user's ID
- **Features**:
  - Owner badge display
  - Full editing and sharing capabilities
  - Sorting controls (title, created date, last modified)
  - Song management actions (View, Edit, Download, Share, Delete)

### Shared with Me
- **Purpose**: Shows songs that have been shared with the current user
- **Criteria**: Songs where user has `read`, `edit`, or `admin` permissions but is not the owner
- **Features**:
  - Permission level badges (Admin, Editor, Reader)
  - Permission-based filtering controls
  - Sorting controls (title, created date, last modified)
  - Permission-appropriate actions (View always available, Edit/Share based on permission level)

## Technical Implementation

### Song Categorization Logic
```typescript
// Determine if song belongs in "My Songs"
const getMySongs = (): Song[] => {
  return songs.filter(song => getUserPermission(song) === 'owner');
};

// Determine if song belongs in "Shared with Me"  
const getSharedSongs = (): Song[] => {
  return songs.filter(song => {
    const permission = getUserPermission(song);
    return permission === 'read' || permission === 'edit' || permission === 'admin';
  });
};
```

### Permission Checking
```typescript
const getUserPermission = (song: Song): string => {
  const currentUser = localStorage.getItem('authUser');
  if (!currentUser) return 'none';
  
  try {
    const user = JSON.parse(currentUser);
    if (song.author_id === user.id) return 'owner';
    return song.user_permission || 'none';
  } catch {
    return 'none';
  }
};
```

### Action Availability
- **View**: Available for all accessible songs
- **Edit**: Available for owner, admin, and edit permissions
- **Share**: Available for owner and admin permissions only
- **Delete**: Available for owners only (not shown in shared section)
- **Download**: Available for all accessible songs
