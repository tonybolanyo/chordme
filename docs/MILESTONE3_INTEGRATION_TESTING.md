## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing Pipeline
The integration tests are designed to run in CI/CD environments:

1. **Unit Tests**: Frontend and backend component testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Cross-feature validation
3. **E2E Tests**: Complete workflow testing
4. **Load Tests**: Performance validation
5. **Security Tests**: OWASP compliance
6. **Validation**: Comprehensive criteria check

### CI Commands
```bash
# Complete test suite for CI
npm run test:all

# Milestone 3 specific validation
npm run validate:milestone3

# Performance benchmarking
npm run test:collaboration:load --users 5 --duration 30
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Backend Server Required
Most integration tests require the backend server running:
```bash
# Start backend for testing
npm run dev:backend
```

#### Browser Dependencies
E2E tests require Playwright browsers:
```bash
# Install browsers
npx playwright install
```

#### Load Testing Limits
Load testing is limited by system resources. Adjust user count based on available memory and CPU.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real-time WebSocket Testing**: Direct WebSocket connection testing
2. **Database Stress Testing**: Database-specific load testing
3. **Network Failure Simulation**: Offline/poor connection testing
4. **Memory Leak Detection**: Long-running collaboration sessions
5. **A/B Testing Framework**: Feature variation testing

### Scalability Testing
- Increase concurrent user limits
- Test with larger song databases
- Validate with complex setlists
- Extended session duration testing
