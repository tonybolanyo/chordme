```

**Solutions**:
- Check test logs in GitHub Actions
- Run tests locally: `npm run test:all`
- Verify configuration files are present
- Check for environment-specific issues

**Problem**: Deployment workflow fails
```
Error: Required secrets not configured
```

**Solutions**:
- Verify all required secrets are set in repository settings
- Check secret names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure secrets have correct permissions/scopes

#### 2. Security Audit Issues

**Problem**: Security workflow reports high-severity vulnerabilities
```
Error: Critical security issues found: 3
```

**Solutions**:
- Review security report artifacts
- Update vulnerable dependencies
- Apply security patches
- Consider temporary workarounds for false positives

#### 3. Deployment Issues

**Problem**: Blue-green deployment stuck in testing phase
```
Error: Green environment health check failed
```

**Solutions**:
- Check application logs in deployment platform
- Verify environment variables are correctly set
- Test green environment manually
- Review rollback procedures

### Debug Workflows

1. **Enable Debug Logging**:
   ```yaml
   # Add to workflow
   env:
     ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
     ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
   ```

2. **Test Workflows Locally**:
   ```bash
   # Use act for local testing
   npm install -g @nektos/act
   act -j frontend-ci
   ```

3. **Validate Configurations**:
   ```bash
   # Check workflow syntax
   github-actions-ctk validate .github/workflows/
   ```

### Getting Help

1. **Check Workflow Logs**: GitHub Actions → Failed workflow → Job details
2. **Review Documentation**: Each workflow has inline documentation
3. **Test Locally**: Use same commands as workflows
4. **Community Support**: GitHub Discussions or project issues

## For Non-Developers

### What Are Workflows?

Think of workflows as **robots that help maintain the website**. Each robot has a specific job:

- **Testing Robot** (`ci.yml`): Checks if new code works properly
- **Security Robot** (`security-audit.yml`): Scans for security problems
- **Deployment Robot** (`deploy-full-stack.yml`): Publishes updates to the live website
- **Emergency Robot** (`emergency-rollback.yml`): Fixes the website if something breaks
- **Maintenance Robot** (`dependency-updates.yml`): Keeps the website components updated

### How They Help

1. **Quality Assurance**: Robots test everything before it goes live
2. **Security**: Daily security scans protect against hackers
3. **Automation**: Reduces manual work and human errors
4. **Fast Recovery**: Emergency procedures minimize downtime
5. **Maintenance**: Automatic updates keep the website secure

### When They Run

- **Automatically**: When developers submit code changes
- **Scheduled**: Daily security scans, weekly maintenance
- **Manual**: Emergency procedures and special deployments
- **On Demand**: When specific actions are needed

### What You See

- **Green Checkmarks**: Everything working properly
- **Red X marks**: Problems that need attention
- **Yellow Warnings**: Issues that should be reviewed
- **Progress Indicators**: Tasks currently running

### Key Benefits

- 🛡️ **Security**: Continuous protection against vulnerabilities
- ⚡ **Speed**: Automated processes are faster than manual work
- 🔄 **Reliability**: Consistent procedures reduce errors
- 📊 **Transparency**: All activities are logged and visible
- 🚨 **Quick Response**: Emergency procedures minimize impact
