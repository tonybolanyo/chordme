## Key Features

### Blue-Green Deployment Workflow
1. **Preparation**: Validate inputs and setup deployment parameters
2. **Build & Test**: Comprehensive testing of the release candidate
3. **Green Deploy**: Deploy to parallel (green) environment
4. **Green Testing**: Validate green environment functionality
5. **Traffic Switch**: Migrate traffic from blue to green
6. **Post-Validation**: Confirm successful deployment
7. **Automatic Rollback**: Revert if any step fails

### Emergency Rollback Workflow
1. **Validation**: Verify rollback target and current state
2. **Backup**: Create backup of current deployment state
3. **Health Check**: Document current environment status
4. **Rollback**: Deploy previous version to production
5. **Validation**: Confirm rollback success
6. **Notification**: Alert stakeholders of rollback completion

### Infrastructure as Code Benefits
- **Reproducible**: Consistent deployments across environments
- **Version Controlled**: Infrastructure changes tracked in Git
- **Cost Optimized**: Separate configurations for staging/production
- **Secure**: Security best practices built-in
- **Scalable**: Auto-scaling and load balancing included

## Usage Examples

### Trigger Blue-Green Deployment
```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run blue-green-deployment.yml \
  -f environment=production \
  -f tag_name=v1.2.0 \
  -f enable_rollback=true

# Via GitHub UI
# Actions → Blue-Green Deployment → Run workflow
```

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run emergency-rollback.yml \
  -f environment=production \
  -f rollback_to_tag=v1.1.0 \
  -f reason="Critical security vulnerability" \
  -f skip_tests=false

# Via GitHub UI
# Actions → Emergency Rollback → Run workflow
```

### Deploy AWS Infrastructure
```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform/aws

# Initialize and apply
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file="production.tfvars"

# With CloudFormation alternative
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name chordme-production \
  --template-body file://../cloudformation/chordme-infrastructure.yaml \
  --parameters file://production-params.json
```

### Run Deployment Tests
```bash
# Smoke tests
python tests/deployment/smoke_tests.py \
  --environment staging \
  --backend-url "https://api.staging.example.com" \
  --frontend-url "https://staging.example.com"

# Integration tests
python -m pytest tests/deployment/ -v --html=reports/deployment.html
```
