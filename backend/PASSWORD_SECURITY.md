# Secure Password Storage Implementation

## Overview

ChordMe implements industry-standard secure password storage using bcrypt hashing algorithm. This implementation ensures that user passwords are never stored in plaintext and provides robust protection against common password attacks.

## Implementation Details

### Bcrypt Configuration

The application uses bcrypt for password hashing with configurable rounds:

- **Production**: 12 rounds (default)
- **Testing**: 4 rounds (for faster test execution)
- **Configurable**: Set via `BCRYPT_ROUNDS` in configuration

```python
# config.py
BCRYPT_ROUNDS = 12  # Default bcrypt rounds for password hashing

# test_config.py
BCRYPT_ROUNDS = 4  # Lower rounds for faster testing
```

### Password Hashing Process

#### 1. Input Validation
- Validates password is not empty
- Ensures password is a string type
- Applies comprehensive password strength requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters, maximum 128
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter  
  - At least one digit
  - No weak patterns (e.g., consecutive identical characters)
  - Not in list of common weak passwords

#### 2. Bcrypt Hashing
```python
def set_password(self, password):
    # Input validation
    if not password:
        raise ValueError("Password cannot be empty")
    
    if not isinstance(password, str):
        raise ValueError("Password must be a string")
    
    # Get configured rounds
    rounds = current_app.config.get('BCRYPT_ROUNDS', 12)
    
    # Hash password
    password_bytes = password.encode('utf-8')
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=rounds)
    password_hash = bcrypt.hashpw(password_bytes, salt)
    
    # Store as string
    self.password_hash = password_hash.decode('utf-8')
```

#### 3. Password Verification
```python
def check_password(self, password):
    # Input validation
    if not password or not isinstance(password, str):
        return False
    
    if not self.password_hash:
        return False
    
    # Verify using bcrypt
    password_bytes = password.encode('utf-8')
    hash_bytes = self.password_hash.encode('utf-8')
    return bcrypt.checkpw(password_bytes, hash_bytes)
```

## Security Features

### 1. Salt Generation
- Each password gets a unique, cryptographically secure salt
- Generated using `bcrypt.gensalt()` with configurable rounds
- Salt is embedded in the hash, no separate storage needed

### 2. Timing Attack Resistance
- bcrypt inherently provides timing attack resistance
- Implementation preserves this protection
- Similar response times for valid/invalid passwords

### 3. Hash Format Security
- Uses bcrypt format: `$2b$rounds$salt+hash`
- Version 2b provides latest security improvements
- 60-character hash length (standard bcrypt)

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of edge cases
- Comprehensive input validation
- Detailed logging for debugging (without exposing sensitive data)

### 5. Configuration Flexibility
- Configurable bcrypt rounds for different environments
- Fallback to secure defaults if configuration unavailable
- Support for future algorithm upgrades

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. No Plaintext Storage
- Passwords are immediately hashed upon receipt
- Original passwords are never stored or logged
- Hash-only storage in database

### 2. Unique Salts
- Every password hash uses a unique salt
- Prevents rainbow table attacks
- Ensures identical passwords have different hashes

### 3. Adequate Work Factor
- 12 rounds for production (recommended for 2024)
- Configurable to adapt to hardware improvements
- Balanced security vs. performance

### 4. Input Sanitization
- Comprehensive password validation
- Protection against common weak passwords
- Unicode support with proper encoding

### 5. Secure Defaults
- Safe fallback values if configuration missing
- Conservative security settings
- Explicit error handling

## Testing Coverage

### Comprehensive Test Suite
The password hashing implementation includes extensive testing:

#### Integration Tests
- Password hashing through registration API
- Password verification through login API
- Special character support (Unicode, emoji, symbols)
- Case sensitivity validation

#### Security Tests
- No password exposure in API responses
- Timing attack resistance verification
- Hash format validation
- Multiple users with same password produce different hashes

#### Edge Case Tests
- Empty password handling
- Missing password handling
- None/invalid type handling
- Maximum length password support

#### Configuration Tests
- Bcrypt rounds configuration
- Different environment settings
- Fallback behavior

### Test Examples

```python
def test_password_hashing_through_registration(self, client):
    """Test password hashing through user registration endpoint."""
    user_data = {
        'email': 'test@example.com',
        'password': 'TestPassword123!'
    }
    
    response = client.post('/api/v1/auth/register',
                         json=user_data,
                         content_type='application/json')
    
    assert response.status_code == 201
    # Password should not be in response
    assert 'password' not in str(response.get_json())
```

## Performance Considerations

### Bcrypt Rounds Selection
- **4 rounds**: ~1ms hashing time (testing only)
- **12 rounds**: ~250ms hashing time (production)
- **15 rounds**: ~2s hashing time (high security)

### Recommendations
- Monitor login/registration response times
- Adjust rounds based on hardware capabilities
- Consider user experience vs. security trade-offs

## Migration and Upgrades

### Configuration Updates
To update bcrypt rounds:
1. Update `BCRYPT_ROUNDS` in configuration
2. New passwords will use new rounds automatically
3. Existing passwords remain valid (bcrypt stores rounds in hash)

### Algorithm Migration
Future algorithm changes (e.g., to Argon2):
1. Add new algorithm support alongside bcrypt
2. Migrate passwords gradually during login
3. Maintain backward compatibility

## Compliance and Standards

### Standards Compliance
- **OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet**: Fully compliant
- **NIST SP 800-63B**: Meets guidelines for password storage
- **PCI DSS**: Satisfies requirements for payment card data

### Algorithm Choice
- **bcrypt**: Industry standard, well-tested
- **FIPS 140-2**: Uses approved cryptographic functions
- **Future-ready**: Configuration supports algorithm upgrades

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Security Monitoring
- Log password hashing failures (without exposing data)
- Monitor for unusual authentication patterns
- Track bcrypt performance metrics

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regularly review bcrypt rounds configuration
- Monitor for new security recommendations
- Update dependencies (bcrypt library)

### Security Audits
- Review password policies periodically
- Test timing attack resistance
- Validate hash format consistency
