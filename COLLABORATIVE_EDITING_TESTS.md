# Collaborative Editing Integration Tests

This document outlines the comprehensive integration tests for the sophisticated real-time collaborative editing system.

## Test Categories

### 1. Multi-User Concurrent Editing Tests

#### Test Case: Simultaneous Text Insertion
```typescript
// Scenario: Two users insert text at different positions simultaneously
// Expected: Both insertions are preserved with correct positioning

const user1Operation = { type: 'insert', position: 5, content: ' world' };
const user2Operation = { type: 'insert', position: 0, content: 'Hello ' };

// After operational transformation:
// Original: "text"
// Result: "Hello text world"
```

#### Test Case: Overlapping Deletions
```typescript
// Scenario: Users delete overlapping text ranges
// Expected: Deletions are merged intelligently without data loss

const user1Delete = { type: 'delete', position: 5, length: 3 };
const user2Delete = { type: 'delete', position: 7, length: 4 };

// Operational transformation merges overlapping deletes
```

#### Test Case: Insert vs Delete Conflicts
```typescript
// Scenario: One user inserts while another deletes at same position
// Expected: Operations are transformed to maintain document consistency
```

### 2. Network Failure Simulation Tests

#### Test Case: Connection Loss During Edit
```typescript
// Scenario: User loses connection while editing
// Expected: 
// 1. Operations are queued locally
// 2. User sees "offline" indicator
// 3. Operations sync when connection restored
// 4. Conflicts are resolved automatically
```

#### Test Case: Partial Network Failures
```typescript
// Scenario: Intermittent connectivity issues
// Expected:
// 1. Automatic retry with exponential backoff
// 2. Connection quality indicator updates
// 3. Graceful degradation to read-only mode if needed
```

#### Test Case: Firestore Permission Errors
```typescript
// Scenario: User's permissions change during active session
// Expected:
// 1. Permission change notification appears
// 2. Interface switches to appropriate access level
// 3. Pending operations are handled gracefully
```

### 3. Permission Change Tests

#### Test Case: Edit to Read-Only Downgrade
```typescript
// Scenario: User's permission changes from edit to read during active editing
// Expected:
// 1. Immediate notification of permission change
// 2. Editor becomes read-only
// 3. Pending edits are saved if possible
// 4. User can view but not edit further
```

#### Test Case: Access Revocation
```typescript
// Scenario: User's access is completely revoked during collaboration
// Expected:
// 1. Session ends gracefully
// 2. User is redirected with appropriate message
// 3. No data corruption occurs
```

### 4. Conflict Resolution Tests

#### Test Case: Auto-Merge Success
```typescript
// Scenario: Non-conflicting changes can be auto-merged
// Expected:
// 1. Changes are merged using operational transformation
// 2. No user intervention required
// 3. All changes are preserved
```

#### Test Case: Manual Merge Required
```typescript
// Scenario: Conflicting changes require manual resolution
// Expected:
// 1. Conflict resolution dialog appears
// 2. Shows both versions clearly
// 3. Provides merge options (keep local, accept remote, manual merge)
// 4. Manual merge shows conflict markers
```

#### Test Case: Merge Preview Generation
```typescript
// Scenario: User chooses manual merge option
// Expected:
// 1. System generates merge preview with conflict markers
// 2. User can edit the merged content
// 3. Conflict markers are properly formatted
// 4. Resolution is applied correctly
```

### 5. Real-Time Features Tests

#### Test Case: Live Cursor Tracking
```typescript
// Scenario: Multiple users move cursors in the editor
// Expected:
// 1. Cursor positions are broadcast in real-time
// 2. Each user has a unique color
// 3. Cursor positions are accurate
// 4. Cursors disappear when users leave
```

#### Test Case: User Presence Indicators
```typescript
// Scenario: Users join and leave the editing session
// Expected:
// 1. Presence indicators show current participants
// 2. Status updates (active/idle/offline) are accurate
// 3. User avatars display correctly
// 4. Participant count is updated in real-time
```

#### Test Case: Optimistic Updates
```typescript
// Scenario: User makes edits with good network connection
// Expected:
// 1. Changes appear immediately (optimistic)
// 2. Changes are confirmed by server
// 3. No rollback occurs for successful operations
```

#### Test Case: Optimistic Update Rollback
```typescript
// Scenario: Server rejects an optimistic update
// Expected:
// 1. Local change is rolled back
// 2. User sees notification about the failure
// 3. Document state remains consistent
// 4. User can retry the operation
```

### 6. Performance and Stress Tests

#### Test Case: Large Document Editing
```typescript
// Scenario: Collaborative editing of very large documents (>10MB)
// Expected:
// 1. Operations remain fast and responsive
// 2. Memory usage stays reasonable
// 3. Network bandwidth is optimized
// 4. UI remains responsive during large operations
```

#### Test Case: Many Concurrent Users
```typescript
// Scenario: 10+ users editing simultaneously
// Expected:
// 1. All operations are processed correctly
// 2. Operational transformation scales appropriately
// 3. Real-time updates don't overwhelm clients
// 4. Firestore quotas are managed efficiently
```

#### Test Case: Rapid Sequential Edits
```typescript
// Scenario: User types very quickly (multiple operations per second)
// Expected:
// 1. Operations are batched efficiently
// 2. No operations are lost
// 3. Document remains consistent
// 4. Other users see changes smoothly
```

### 7. Edge Case Tests

#### Test Case: Empty Document Collaboration
```typescript
// Scenario: Multiple users start editing an empty document
// Expected:
// 1. First user's edits appear correctly
// 2. Subsequent users see updates in real-time
// 3. No positioning errors occur
```

#### Test Case: Unicode and Special Characters
```typescript
// Scenario: Users edit text with emojis, accented characters, etc.
// Expected:
// 1. Character positions are calculated correctly
// 2. Operations work with multi-byte characters
// 3. Cursor tracking accounts for character width
```

#### Test Case: Very Long Lines
```typescript
// Scenario: Users edit documents with extremely long lines (>10k characters)
// Expected:
// 1. Cursor positioning remains accurate
// 2. Operations are processed efficiently
// 3. UI performance is maintained
```

## Automated Test Implementation

### Test Infrastructure
```typescript
// Test utilities for simulating multi-user scenarios
class CollaborationTestHarness {
  async simulateUsers(count: number): Promise<TestUser[]> {
    // Create multiple test users with isolated sessions
  }
  
  async simulateNetworkFailure(user: TestUser, duration: number): Promise<void> {
    // Simulate network interruption for specific user
  }
  
  async simulatePermissionChange(user: TestUser, newPermission: string): Promise<void> {
    // Simulate server-side permission change
  }
}
```

    { type: 'insert', position: 0, content: 'Hello ' },
    { type: 'insert', position: 6, content: 'World' }
  ],
  
  conflictingEdits: [
    // User 1
    { type: 'insert', position: 5, content: ' beautiful' },
    // User 2 (concurrent)
    { type: 'delete', position: 3, length: 4 }
  ],
  
  rapidTyping: [
    // Simulates rapid typing with 50ms intervals
    ...Array.from({length: 20}, (_, i) => ({
      type: 'insert',
      position: i,
      content: String.fromCharCode(65 + i), // A, B, C, ...
